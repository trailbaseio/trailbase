## How is TrailBase different from PocketBase, SupaBase or other application bases?

Naturally there's a lot of overlap but let's start by saying that
we're also huge fans of SupaBase and PocketBase.
The former is incredibly versatile, while the latter is incredibly easy and
cheap to use.
As far as we can tell, PocketBase pioneered the notion of a single-file,
SQLite-based, FireBase-like server.

TrailBase is an attempt at combining the flexibility and principled
architecture of SupaBase with the ease and low-overhead of PocketBase.
We owe a great debt of gratitude to both ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Let's address the elephant in the room: other more established solutions are
more polished, may have more extensive feature sets in many areas, and have
seen a lot more mileage.
TrailBase is committed to catch up and challenge the status quo following our
[principles](/getting-started/philosophy) and in many ways, TrailBase is
already incredibly easy to deploy and [blazingly fast](/reference/benchmarks).

We also offer some slightly more detailed comparisons to both
[PocketBase](/comparison/pocketbase) and [SupaBase](/comparison/supabase).

## Is TrailBase ready for production use?

TrailBase has not seen a lot of mileage yet and there's probably plenty of
sharp edges, which will take some time to smooth over.
That said, it's also incredibly simple, easy to get on, and easy to get off.
We're welcoming any brave soul who would like to be an early adopter.
If you're curious and patient, we're ready to help you get off the ground in
return for your honest feedback üôè.
You can take a look at the preliminary
[productionization](/documentation/production).

## Scale, performance and reliability

As my product grows, will TrailBase scale with me or will I hit a wall?
Firstly, congratulations! The "success"-problem is a great problem to have üéâ.

Short, hand-wavy answer: you'll face all the same issues as with other
solutions but you probably will be fine üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è .

Long answer: TrailBase currently only scales vertically, however it's incredibly
fast. Besides, there's an inherent beauty to vertical scaling [^1] and modern
servers can get you very very far.
You can absolutely support tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of
concurrent users with a single database.
With TrailBase simple deployment, it may also be an option to shard your users
or tenants across multiple databases. In the future, TrailBase would also like
to support multi-database setups out-of-the-box to further improve concurrency.

Keep in mind that other databases, like MySQL or Postgres, aren't a silver bullet either.
If you're reaching massive levels of scale, more specialized solutions will
become more and more attractive such as non-relational document stores,
columnar OLAP stores for analytic workloads, ...

TrailBase explicitly tries to avoid tight coupling locking you in. At the end
of the day, you're using very plain SQLite, letting you adopt and drop
TrailBase when it makes sense.
Similarly, the stateless auth flow makes it easy to split out your logic and
data while continuing to use TrailBase.

Besides pure scale and performance, many more horizontal solutions provide
additional benefits such as disaster-recovery/fail-over or improved edge read
latency.
Fortunately, both can be achieved with SQLite as well using solutions like
[LiteStream](https://litestream.io/) keeping eventually consistent copies of
your data.

## Can we add Features to TrailBase?

Yes! First take a look at our coarse [roadmap](/reference/roadmap), maybe we're
already working on it?
Otherwise, don't hesitate, just open an issue and ask away. We love to hear
your thoughts.
Contributions are also very welcome, let's just talk upfront to avoid any
surprises.
Especially, in the early days we'll have to see how "things" fit into the
roadmap.
For example, having a dark mode for the dashboard would be nice but it's also
extra work to maintain while the dashboard is still rapidly changing, so it
becomes a question of when.

## Data Import & Export

Few requirements: `STRICT` table and an auto-incrementing primary key for
collections but the dashboard will work for any table, view, etc.
You can simply import and export data with standard SQLite tooling, e.g.:

```shell
sqlite3 main.db < import.sql
```

    Adopting more complex multi-tiered database solutions comes with its own
    challenges for operations, testing, and developer setups.
