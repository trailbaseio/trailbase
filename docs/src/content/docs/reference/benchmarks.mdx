TrailBase is merely the sum of its parts. It's the result of marrying one of
the lowest-overhead languages, one of the fastest HTTP servers, and one of the
lightest relational SQL databases, while mostly avoiding extra expenditures.
We can expect it to go fast but how fast exactly? Let's compare it to a few
amazing, and certainly more weathered alternatives such as SupaBase,
PocketBase, and vanilla SQLite.

### Disclaimer

Generally benchmarks are tricky, both to do well and to interpret.
Benchmarks **never show how fast something *can* go but merely how
fast the author managed to make it go**.
Micro-benchmarks, especially, offer a key-hole insights, which may be biased
and may not apply to your workload.

Performance also doesn't exist in a vacuum. If something is super fast but
doesn't do what you need it to do, performance is an illusive luxury.
Doing less makes it naturally easier to go fast, which is not a bad thing,
however means that comparing a highly specialized solution to a more general
one may be misleading, unfair or irrelevant for you.

We tried our hardest to give all contenders the best shot[^1] [^4].
If you have any suggestions on how to make anyone go faster, make the comparison more
apples-to-apples or see any issues,
[let us know](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark).
Even with a chunky grain of salt, we hope the results can provide some
interesting insights.
In the end, nothing beats benchmarking your own setup and workloads.

## Insertion Benchmarks

_Total Time for 100k Insertions_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[400px] w-[90%]">
    <Duration100kInsertsChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

The graph shows the overall time it takes to insert 100k messages into a mock
*chat-room* table setup, i.e. less is better. Click the labels to toggle
individual measurements.

Maybe surprisingly, remote TrailBase is slightly quicker than in-process
vanilla SQLite with drizzle and Node.js[^2].
This is an apples to oranges comparison and was intended to establish an upper
bound on the cost incurred by IPC leaving the process boundary[^3] and adding
features like authorization, i.e. more table look-ups.

Looking at the other, more similar setups, the measurement suggests that for
this test TrailBase can insert 100k records 100+ times faster than Payload[^4],
more than 20 times faster than SupaBase[^5], and comfortably 10 times faster
than PocketBase [^1].

The total time of inserting a large batch of data tells only part of the story.
Let's have a look at resource consumption to get an intuition for provisioning
or footprint requirements, i.e. what kind of machine one would need:

_TrailBase & PocketBase Utilization_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[300px] w-[90%]">
    <PocketBaseAndTrailBaseUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

The graph shows the CPU utilization and memory consumption (RSS) of both
PocketBase and TrailBase. Squinting, they look fairly similar apart from
TrailBase finishing earlier.
They load roughly 3 and 4 CPUs, respectively. PocketBase's CPU consumption
being slightly more variable [^6].

In terms of memory consumption, they're also both fairly similar consuming
between 100MB and 120MB  making them suitable for a tiny VPS or a toaster.
Though, when TrailBase finished, it had not yet saturated.
Note that RSS is not an accurate measure of how much memory a process needs but
rather how much memory has been allocated from the OS. Allocators will
typically retrieve large chunks of memory and occasionally return memory based on
consumption, fragmentation and strategy.
This is also why TrailBase's allocated memory doesn't drop after the load goes
away. TrailBase currently uses Mimalloc, which holds on to memory at idle.
Independently, fragmentation is a problem where a garbage-collector running
compactions can help.

Now shifting to SupaBase, things get a bit more involved due to its
[layered architecture](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture)
including a dozen separate services providing various functionality:

_SupaBase Memory Usage_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[340px] w-[90%]">
    <SupaBaseMemoryUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Looking at SupaBase's memory usage, it increased from from roughly 6GB at rest to
7GB fully loaded.
This means that out of the box, SupaBase has roughly 50 times the memory
footprint of either PocketBase or TrailBase.
In all fairness, a lot of SupaBase's functionality isn't needed for this benchmark
and it might be possible to shed less critical services, e.g. removing
*supabase-analytics* would save ~40% of memory.
That said, we don't know how feasible this is in practice.

_SupaBase CPU utilization_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[340px] w-[90%]">
    <SupaBaseCpuUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

As for CPU usage, one can see it jump up to roughly 9 cores (the benchmark ran
on a machine with 8 physical cores and 16 threads: 7840U).
Most of the CPUs seem to be consumed by *supabase-rest*, the API frontend, with
postgres itself hovering at only about 0.7 cores. Also, *supabase-analytics*
definitely seems to be in use.

## Latency and Read Performance

Let's take a closer look at latency distributions. To keep things manageable
we'll focus on PocketBase and TrailBase, which are architecturally simpler and
more comparable.

For TrailBase, reads were on average 9x (C#) and insertions 10x faster. The
latter is in line with the throughput results we've seen above.

<div class="flex justify-center h-[340px] w-[90%]">
  <div class="w-[50%]">
    <PocketBaseAndTrailBaseReadLatencies client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>

  <div class="w-[50%]">
    <PocketBaseAndTrailBaseInsertLatencies client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Latencies are generally lower for TrailBase. Maybe interestingly the insert
latencies for the Dart and C# client are fairly similar, while reads with Dart
take about 3 times longer compared to C#. TrailBase is fast enough that we're
being bottlenecked on the client. The minimum latency you can expect from Dart
and Node.js is around 3-5ms.
This likely means that the bottleneck for PocketBase is on the server-side.

With sub-millisecond read latencies at full tilt, TrailBase is in the same
ballpark as something like Redis, however this is primary data and **not a
cache!**
Not needing a dedicated cache eliminates an entire class of issues around
consistency, invalidation and can greatly simplify a stack.

Looking at the latency distributions we can see that the spread is well
contained for TrailBase. For PocketBase, read latencies are well contained.
However, insert latencies show a more significant "tail" with the p90 latency
being roughly 5 times slower than p50.
Slower insertions can take north of 100ms. This may be related to GC pauses,
scheduling, or more generally the same CPU variability we observed earlier.

## File System Performance

File systems play an important role for the performance of storage systems,
we'll therefore take a quick at their impact on SQLite/TrailBase's performance.

Note that the numbers aren't directly comparable to the ones above, due to
being taken on a different machine with more storage options,
specifically an AMD 8700G with a 2TB WD SN850x NVMe SSD running a 6.12 kernel.

<div class="flex justify-center h-[340px] w-[90%]">
  <div class="w-[50%]">
    <TrailBaseFileSystemReadLatency client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>

  <div class="w-[50%]">
    <TrailBaseFileSystemWriteLatency client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Interestingly, the read performance appears identical suggesting that caching
is at play w/o much real file system interaction.
In the future we should rerun with a larger data set to observe the degraded
performance for when not everything fits into memory anymore.
Yet, most queries being cached is a not too uncommon reality and it's
reassuring to see that caches are indeed working independent of the file system
😅.

The write latencies are bit more interesting. Unsurprisingly modern
copy-on-write (CoW) file systems have a bit more overhead. The relative ranking
is roughly in line with
[Phoronix'](https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-611-filesystems/2)
results[^7], with the added OpenZFS (2.2.7) falling in line with its peers.
Also, the differences are attenuated due to the constant overhead TrailBase
adds over vanilla SQLite.

We won't discuss the specific trade-offs and baggage coming with each file
system but hope that the numbers can help guide the optimization of your own
production setup.
In the end its a trade-off between performance, maturity, reliability, physical
disc space and feature sets. For example, CoW snapshots may or may not be
important to you.


## JavaScript Performance

The benchmark sets up a custom HTTP endpoint `/fibonacci?n=<N>` using the same
slow recursive Fibonacci
[implementation](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark/blob/main/setups/trailbase/traildepot/scripts/index.ts)
for both, PocketBase and TrailBase.
This is meant as a proxy for a computationally heavy workload to primarily
benchmark the performance of the underlying JavaScript engines:
[goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) for PocketBase and [V8](https://v8.dev/) for TrailBase.
In other words, the impact of any overhead within PocketBase or TrailBase is
diminished by the time it takes to compute `fibonacci(N)` for sufficiently
large `N`.

{/*
Output:
  TB: Called "/fibonacci" for fib(40) 100 times, took 0:00:14.988703 (limit=64)
  PB: Called "/fibonacci" for fib(40) 100 times, took 0:10:01.096053 (limit=64)
*/}

We found that for `N=40`, V8 (TrailBase) is around 40 times faster than
goja (PocketBase):

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[300px] w-[90%]">
    <FibonacciPocketBaseAndTrailBaseUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Interestingly, PocketBase has an initial warm-up of ~30s where it doesn't
parallelize.
Not being familiar with [goja's](https://github.com/dop251/goja) execution model,
one would expect similar behavior for a conservative JIT threshold in
combination with a global interpreter lock 🤷.
However, even after using all cores completing the benchmark takes
significantly longer.

With the addition of V8 to TrailBase, we've experienced a significant increase
in the memory baseline dominating the overall footprint.
In this setup, TrailBase consumes roughly 4 times more memory than PocketBase.
If memory footprint is a major concern for you, constraining the number of V8
threads will be an effective remedy (`--js-runtime-threads`).

## Final Words

We're very happy to confirm that TrailBase's APIs and JS/ES6/TS runtime are
quick.
The significant performance gap we observed for API access is a consequence of
how fast SQLite itself is making even small overheads matter that much more.

With the numbers fresh off the press, prudence is of the essence and ultimately
nothing beats benchmarking your own setup and workloads.
In any case, we hope this was at least somewhat insightful. Let us know if you see
anything that can or should be improved.
The benchmarks are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark).

[^1]:
    Trying to give PocketBase the best chance, the binary was built with the
    latest go compiler (v1.23.1 at the time of writing), `CGO_ENABLED=1` (which
    according to PB's own documentation will use a faster C-based SQLite
    driver) and `GOAMD64=v4` (for less portable but more aggressive CPU
    optimizations).
    We found this setup to be roughly 20% faster than the static, pre-built
    binary release.

[^2]:
    Our setup with drizzle and node.js is certainly not the fastest possible.
    For example, we could drop down to SQLite in C or another low-level
    language with less FFI overhead.
    That said, drizzle is a great popular choice which mostly serves as a
    point-of-reference and sanity check.

[^3]:
    The actual magnitude on IPC overhead will depend on the communication cost.
    For the our benchmarks we were using the loopback network device.

[^4]:
    We picked Payload as representative of popular Node.js CMS, which
    [itself claims](https://payloadcms.com/blog/performance-benchmarks)
    to be many times faster than popular options like Strapi or Directus.
    We were using a v3 pre-release, as recommended, also using the
    SQLite/drizzle database adapter marked as beta.
    We manually turned on WAL mode and filed an issue with payload, otherwise
    stock payload was ~300x slower. That said, we've seen drizzle perform
    very well meaning there's probably something very wrong here. Given the
    magnitude, the competition would have likely performed better.

[^5]:
    The SupaBase benchmark setup skips row-level access checks. Technically,
    this is in its favor from a performance standpoint, however looking at the
    overall load on its constituents with PG being only a sliver, it probably
    would not make much of an overall difference nor would PG17's vectorization,
    which has been released since the benchmarks were run. That said, these
    claims deserve re-validation.

[^6]:
    We're unsure as to what causes these 1-core swings.
    Runtime-effects, such as garbage collection, may have an effect, however we
    would have expected these to show on shorter time-scales.
    This could also indicate a contention or thrashing issue 🤷.

[^7]:
    Despite being close, XFS' and ext4's relative ranking is swapped, which
    could be due to a variety of reason like mount options, kernel version,
    hardware, ...
