title: Roadmap
---

Over time, we would like to make TrailBase the best application base it can be.
Tell us what's missing, what could be better, and what smells.
Independently, we're very open to contributions, just talk to us first so we
can figure out how any feature will fit into the overall picture to minimize
friction.
For context, some of the larger items on our Roadmap are:

- Multi-tenancy - multi-DB is already supported, however we might want support
  creation of and routing to per-tenant DBs based on schema templates.
- Multi-factor internal user auth and service-accounts for better backend auth.
- Point-in-time-recovery via generational backups, CoW checkpoints or SQLite
  sessions.
- A message queue system to deal with slow tasks or bursty workloads.
- We might want to address fan-out and the integration of side-car services
  through GraphQL or similar.
