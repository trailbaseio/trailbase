    An open, blazingly fast, single-executable Firebase alternative with
    type-safe REST & realtime APIs, built-in JS/ES6/TS runtime, SSR,
    auth and admin UI built on Rust, SQLite & V8.
    <br />
    <br />
    Simplify with fewer moving parts&colon; an easy to self-host
    single-executable with everything you need to focus on your mobile, web or
    desktop application.
    Sub-millisecond latencies eliminate the need for dedicated caches, no more
    stale or inconsistent data.

      Blazingly fast thanks to its constituents:

      * Rust: one of the lowest overhead languages,
      * Axum: one of the fastest HTTP servers,
      * SQLite: one of the fastest full-SQL databases,
      * V8: one of the fastest JS engines.

      TrailBase's APIs are [11x faster than PocketBase's and almost 40x faster than SupaBase's
      with a fraction of the footprint](/reference/benchmarks) allowing you to
      serve millions of customers from a tiny box.

      In terms of JS/TS performance, V8 is roughly
      [40x faster](/reference/benchmarks#javascript)
      than goja used by PocketBase.

  <Card title="Admin Dashboard" icon="setting">
    TrailBase ships with a builtin admin dashboard UI that lets you quickly
    configure your instance and visually explore your data.
    Check out the **live demo** below.
    Following TrailBase's mantra of not getting in your way, the UI is
    entirely optional letting you fall back to a purely config and
    migration-based setup for integration tests or managing a fleet of
    deployments.

    <Card title="Simple" icon="heart">
      TrailBase is a small static binary that is incredibly easy to deploy
      **consistently** across integration testing, development, pre-prod, and
      production environments including edge.
      Architecturally, TrailBase aims to be a simple, thin abstraction around
      standards helping full or piece-meal adoption and avoiding lock-in.

      A simple architecture, both in your dependencies and your own App, will
      let you move faster, more confidently and pivot when necessary.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Authentication" icon="open-book">
      TrailBase comes with an authentication system and UI built in supporting
      both password-based and Social/OAuth (Google, Discord, ...) sign-ups.

      TrailBase authentication system follows standards and best-practices
      combining short-lived, stateless JSON web tokens with long-lived stateful
      refresh tokens letting you easily and efficiently authenticate your users
      from any of your other back-ends relying on safe, asymmetric cryptography.
    </Card>

    <Card title="APIs & File Storage" icon="random">
      Provide access to your tables and views through fast, flexible and
      **type-safe** restful CRUD APIs.
      Listen for data changes with realtime APIs and extend functionality
      using a fast V8 JS/ES6 runtime with built-in support for TypeScript.

      Authorize users based on ACLs and SQL access rules letting you
      easily build higher-level access management or moderation facilities
      like groups or capabilities.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Integrations" icon="puzzle">
      Straightforward integration with any stack thanks to thin abstractions,
      reliance on standards, and JSON Schema for type-safety allowing type-safe
      bindings for virtually any language.

      Clients as well as code-generation examples for TypeScript,
      Dart/Flutter, Python, C#/.NET and Rust are provided out of the box.
