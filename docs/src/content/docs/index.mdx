      Blazingly fast thanks to its constituents:

      * Rust: one of the lowest overhead languages,
      * Axum: one of the fastest HTTP servers,
      * SQLite: one of the fastest full-SQL databases,
      * Wasmtime: compiles custom endpoints to efficient native code.

      TrailBase's APIs are [11x faster than PocketBase's and almost 40x faster than SupaBase's
      with a fraction of the footprint](/reference/benchmarks) allowing you to
      serve millions of customers from a tiny box.

  <Card title="Admin Dashboard" icon="setting">
    TrailBase ships with a builtin admin dashboard UI that lets you quickly
    configure your instance and visually explore your data.
    Check out the **live demo** below.
    Following TrailBase's mantra of not getting in your way, the UI is
    entirely optional letting you fall back to a purely config and
    migration-based setup for integration tests or managing a fleet of
    deployments.

  <Card title="Integrations" icon="puzzle">
    Straightforward integration with any stack thanks to thin abstractions,
    reliance on standards, and JSON Schema for type-safety allowing type-safe
    bindings for virtually any language.

    Clients as well as code-generation examples for TypeScript,
    Dart/Flutter, Python, C#/.NET and Rust are provided out of the box.

    <Card title="Simple & Consistent" icon="heart">
      TrailBase is a single executable that is incredibly
      easy to deploy **consistently** across integration testing, development,
      pre-prod, and production environments including edge.
      Architecturally, TrailBase aims to be a simple, thin abstraction around
      standards helping full or piece-meal adoption and avoiding lock-in.

      A simple architecture for your App and also your dependencies lets you
      move faster, more confidently and pivot when necessary.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Built-in Auth" icon="open-book">
      TrailBase comes with an auth system and UI built in supporting
      both password-based and Social/OAuth (Google, Discord, ...) sign-ups.

      TrailBase's auth system follows standards and best-practices
      combining short-lived, stateless JSON web tokens with long-lived stateful
      refresh tokens letting you easily and efficiently authenticate your users
      from any of your other back-ends relying on safe, asymmetric cryptography.
    </Card>

    <Card title="APIs & File Storage" icon="random">
      Provide access to your tables and views through fast, flexible and
      **type-safe** restful CRUD APIs.
      Listen for data changes with realtime APIs and extend functionality using
      a fast WebAssembly runtime with support for many guest languages.

      Authorize users based on ACLs and SQL access rules letting you
      easily build higher-level access management or moderation facilities
      like groups or capabilities.
