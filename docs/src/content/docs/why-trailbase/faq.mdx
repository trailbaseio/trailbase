## Who is TrailBase for?

TrailBase is very flexible and can be a lot to a lot of people. The most
prominent use-cases is developers or teams, who want to focus on a client-side
experience (mobile app, progressive web app, desktop, ...) and need a backend
to solve common challenges for them like persistent relational storage, APIs,
authentication, file uploads, realtime data updates, logs, background jobs,
SQL data analysis... .

Besides its features, TrailBase provides other tangible benefits:

* As a small portable single-executable it's easy to deploy *consistently*
  across environments such as testing, development, and prod.
  In contrast, spinning up a bunch of services and waiting for them to be
  healthy may be prohibitive for unit tests leading to inconsistencies lowering
  the coverage and quality of your tests while slowing you down your overall
  development.
* TrailBase is quick, much quicker than many full-stack frameworks.
  Sub-millisecond response times and high concurrency eliminate the need for
  dedicated caches.
  This can simplify your stack and completely eliminating cache invalidation
  challenges.
  It may also improve the quality and consistency of your user-facing product.
* It gives you untethered access to the underlying database allowing you to
  unleash the full power of SQL or break glass *if and when needed*.

In the end, TrailBase is modular by design, allowing you to use only what you
need and combine it with other technologies.
For example, you could use it for auth and relational data and combine it with
a document store, a queuing system, ... .


## Is TrailBase Ready for Production?

Yes and no. TrailBase is well tested but is still new and hasn't seen as much
mileage as more weathered solutions.
Especially if you're an enthusiast and working on a project that's not
literally life-or-death, we're keen to give you hands-on support with quick
turnarounds smoothing over any sharp edges.
If you're feeling adventures, TrailBase is incredibly easy to get on and easy
to get off, if needed.
No matter your experience, we want to improve and very much welcome your honest
feedback üôè.

You can take a look at the early-stage [productionization](/documentation/production) docs.


## How is TrailBase Different from PocketBase, SupaBase and Others?

Naturally there's a lot of overlap but let's start by saying that we're also
huge fans of SupaBase and PocketBase.
The former is incredibly versatile, while the latter is incredibly easy and
cheap to use.
As far as we can tell, PocketBase pioneered the notion of a single-executable,
SQLite-based, FireBase-like offering.

*TrailBase tries to combe the flexibility and principled architecture of
SupaBase with the ease and low-overhead of PocketBase*.
We owe a great debt of gratitude to both ‚ù§Ô∏è.

TrailBase already provides a comprehensive, similar feature set, is super easy
to deploy and incredibly [fast](/reference/benchmarks).
For details, you can check out the more detailed comparisons to both
[PocketBase](/comparison/pocketbase) and [SupaBase](/comparison/supabase).


## Scale, Performance and Reliability

As my product grows in size, will TrailBase scale with me or will I hit a wall
eventually?
Let's start by reminding ourselves that the *success*-problem is a actually
great problem to have üéâ.

*Short, hand-wavy answer*: SQLite and TrailBase are incredibly
[fast](/reference/benchmarks).
Depending on your workload you may even be able to go further before eventually
facing very similar issues to other databases.
Unless you're handling hundreds of thousands of latency-critical, consistent
writes per second, you will be fine üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è[^1].

*Long answer*: in terms of scaling, SQLite and thus TrailBase are very similar
to something like Postgres.
They allow both for "multi-reader, single-writer" horizontal scaling, i.e. both
allow for read replication.
The main difference is write-lock granularity, with Postgres having more
granular ones.
This added complexity may or may not be a benefit for your workload. In
practice, SQLite is often taking a sizable lead even for mixed read/write
workloads [^2].

There are more "truly" horizontal relational solutions such as [vitess](https://vitess.io/),
however they come with their own challenges such as overhead, operational and
maintenance costs.
When applicable, there's an inherent simplicity and beauty to vertical scaling.
Modern hardware can get you very very far, with not breaking a sweat over tens
or even hundreds of thousands of concurrent users.

Multi-tenant setups, i.e. partitioning your database by user, are an advanced
way[^3] to shard horizontally using any technology.
TrailBase being a small, portable single-executable may simplify such a setup
with a separate instance per user.

Keep in mind: there's no silver bullet. As you approach massive scale, more
specialized solutions will come into focus to accelerate specific workflows
such as caches, document stores or columnar OLAP stores for analytics.
TrailBase explicitly tries to be modular and avoid tight coupling or lock-in.
The goal is to let you adopt, extend or even replace TrailBase when and where
it makes sense.

Scaling aside, horizontal solutions often provide additional benefits such as
disaster-recovery/fail-over or improved edge read latency.
Fortunately, both can be achieved with SQLite as well using solutions like
[LiteStream](https://litestream.io/) keeping eventually consistent copies of
your data.
We're also exploring built-in distribution strategies for the future such as
rqlite, hiqlite, ... .


## Can I Add Features to TrailBase?

Yes! First take a look at our coarse [roadmap](/reference/roadmap), maybe we're
already working on it?
Otherwise, don't hesitate, just open an issue and ask away. We love to hear
your thoughts.
Contributions are also very welcome, let's just talk upfront to avoid any
surprises.
Especially, in the early days we'll have to see how "things" fit into the
roadmap.
For example, having a dark mode for the dashboard would be nice but it's also
extra work to maintain while the dashboard is still rapidly changing, so it
becomes a question of when.


## Data Import & Export

Few requirements: `STRICT` table and an auto-incrementing primary key for
collections but the dashboard will work for any table, view, etc.
You can simply import and export data with standard SQLite tooling, e.g.:

```shell
sqlite3 main.db < import.sql
```

[^1]:
    Reaching that level of performance with other more complex, sharded
    databases isn't trivial either and comes with its own challenges such as
    significantly higher operational and maintenance cost.
    For example, Postgres is great but it
    [doesn't scale well horizontally for writes](https://fly.io/blog/globally-distributed-postgres/).
    We'd probably be looking at something like a sizable [vitess](https://vitess.io/)
    clusters.

[^2]:
    We don't promote any specific benchmarks here, because Postgres and SQLite
    are architecturally quite different especially when it comes to
    communication overhead. Many benchmarks compare apples to oranges and we
    encourage you to do your own research or even better: benchmark your own
    workload.
