description: Comparing TrailBase & PocketBase.
---

Firstly, PocketBase is amazing! It blazed the trail for single-executable,
SQLite application bases, is incredibly easy-to-use, and a polished
experience. Gani, the person behind it, is a mad scientist.

At the surface-level there are a lot of similarities between PocketBase and
TrailBase. In this comparison, we'll dive a little deeper and have a closer
look at the technical as well as philosophical differences between the two.

### Goals & Aspirations

TrailBase was born out of admiration for PocketBase trying to move the needle
in a few areas:

- Less abstraction, embracing standards (SQL[^1], JWT, UUID), and untethered access
  to SQLite[^2] including features such as recursive CTEs, virtual tables
  and vector search.
  The goal is to not get in your way and avoid lock-in by bespoke solutions
  making it easier adopt TrailBase either fully or as piece-meal as well as
  getting rid of it based on your product needs.
- Be just as easy to self-host and be even easier to manage a fleet of
  deployments across integration tests, development, and production by separating
  data, configuration, and secrets.
- Super-powers through SQLite extensions (regex, GIS, ...) including your own [^3].
- Be lightweight enough to rival plain SQLite performance at least for
  higher-level languages.
- Be simple and flexible enough to be an attractive alternative to plain SQLite
  for serving **and** data analysis use-cases.

### Differences

It's worth noting that PocketBase and TrailBase have a lot in common: they are
both single static binaries providing CRUD plus realtime APIs, JavaScript
runtimes, authentication and file storage on top of SQLite.
That said and for the sake of this article, let's look at some of the
differences and extra features that PocketBase provides:

- PocketBase can also be used as a Go framework, i.e. instead of using the
  binary release one can build a custom binary with custom endpoints.
  Similarly you can use Rust to do the same with TrailBase.

Likewise, TrailBase has a few nifty tricks up its sleeve:

- Language independent type-safety via JSON Schemas with strict typing
  being enforced all the way down to the database level[^4].
- TrailBase's JavaScript runtime supports full ES6, TypeScript transpilation,
  and is built on V8 making it [~40x faster](/reference/benchmarks/#javascript-performance).
  Supporting ES makes it easier to integrate popular JS frameworks for SSR.
- First-class access to all of SQLite's features and capabilities.
- A simple auth UI.
- Stateless JWT auth-tokens for simple, hermetic authentication in other
  backends.
- Efficient and stable cursor-based pagination.
- An admin UI that "works" on small screens and mobile :)

### Language & Performance

Another difference is that PocketBase is written in Go, while TrailBase uses
Rust. Beyond feelings this may matter to you when using them as a "framework"
or modifying the core.

In practice, both languages are speedy options with a rich ecosystem.
That said, Rust's lack of a runtime and lower FFI overhead should make it the
more performant choice.
Measuring we found a significant gap with TrailBase's APIs being roughly
[10x and JS runtime 40x faster](/reference/benchmarks/).
This is the result of SQLite of first-class JS engines being so quick that even
small overheads weight heavily.

[^1]: Maybe more in line with SupaBase's philosophy. We suspect that PocketBase
  relies on schema metadata by construction requiring alterations to be
  mediated through PocketBase APIs to stay in sync.

[^2]: We believe that SQL a ubiquitous evergreen technology, which in of itself
  is already a high-level abstraction for efficient, unified cross-database
  access.
  Even higher-level abstractions, such as ORMs, often look nice for simple
  examples but quickly fall flat for more complex ones. They're certainly
  bespoke, non-transferable knowledge, and increase vendor lock-in.

[^3]:
    All extensions can be built into a small, standalone shared library and
    imported by vanilla SQLite avoiding vendor lock-in.

[^4]: SQLite is not strictly typed by default. Instead column types merely a
    type affinity for value conversions.
