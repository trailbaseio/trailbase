You can place JavaScript and TypeScript into `traildepot/scripts` and TrailBase
will automatically load them on startup.
For now we support custom HTTP handlers letting you register routes, act on
requests, query the database and build arbitrary responses.

## Runtime

Before we jump into details, let's quickly talk about the runtime itself. At
its heart, it's a pool of V8-js-engines alongside a runtime that supports basic
tasks such as file I/O, web requests, timers, etc.
However, it is *not* a complete Node.js runtime, at least for now, since it
would pull in a lot of extra dependencies.
Note further, that the pool of workers/isolates does not share state, i.e. you
cannot use global state to reliably share state across requests. You should
rely on the database for persisting and sharing state.

## HTTP Endpoints

The following example illustrates a few things:

* How to register a parameterized route with `:table`.
* How to implement a handler that returns `text/plain` content. There is also
  `jsonHandler` and `htmlHandler`.
* How to query the database.
* How to return an error.

```js
import {
  addRoute,
  query,
  stringHandler,
  HttpError,
  StatusCodes
} from "../trailbase.js";

addRoute("GET", "/test/:table", stringHandler(async (req) => {
  const table = req.params["table"];
  if (table) {
    const rows = await query(`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${table}`, [])
    return `entries: ${rows[0][0]}`;
  }

  throw new HttpError(
      StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST, "Missing '?table=' search query parm");
}));
```

More examples can be found in the repository in
`client/testfixture/scripts/index.ts`.
