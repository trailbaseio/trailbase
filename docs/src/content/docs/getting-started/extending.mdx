This article explores different ways to integrate your App with TrailBase,
extend it and your custom logic.

The question of where code should run weighs heavily on the web: push
everything to the server, more to the client or even the edge?
Answering this question is s a lot simpler for rich client-side applications
such as mobile, desktop, and progressive web apps or SPAs where the inclination
is to run on the users device providing privacy friendly, snappy interactivity
and offline capabilities.
There are perfectly good reasons to not run everything in an untrusted, battery
limited, SEO unfriendly client-side sandbox but the overall need for
server-side execution is greatly reduced.
**It's rich client-side apps where application servers like TrailBase can shine
providing common server-side functionality and strategic extension points**.


## Custom APIs in TrailBase

TrailBase provides a couple of ways to embed custom logic and provide custom APIs endpoints:

1. Rust HTTP handlers using Axum
2. JS/TS endpoints
3. Stored database procedures
3. SQLite extensions and modules (virtual tables)

<Aside type="note" title="Rust Handlers">
  the Rust APIs are subject to change. However, we will rely on semantic
  versioning to communicate breaking changes explicitly.
</Aside>

### Using ES6 JS/TS Endpoints

You can write custom HTTP endpoints using both full ES6 JavaScript and/or
TypeScript. TrailBase will transpile your code on the fly and execute it on a
speedy V8-engine, the same engine found across Chrome, node.js and deno.

At its heart, it's a pool of V8-js-engines alongside a runtime that supports basic
tasks such as file I/O, web requests, timers, etc.
However, it is *not* a complete Node.js runtime, at least for now, since it
would pull in a lot of extra dependencies.
Note further, that the pool of workers/isolates does not share state, i.e. you
cannot use global state to reliably share state across requests. You should
rely on the database for persisting and sharing state.

The following example illustrates a few things:

* How to register a parameterized route with `:table`.
* How to implement a handler that returns `text/plain` content. There is also
  `jsonHandler` and `htmlHandler`.
* How to query the database.
* How to return an error.

```js
import {
  addRoute,
  query,
  stringHandler,
  HttpError,
  StatusCodes
} from "../trailbase.js";

addRoute("GET", "/test/{table}", stringHandler(async (req) => {
  const table = req.params["table"];
  if (table) {
    const rows = await query(`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${table}`, [])
    return `entries: ${rows[0][0]}`;
  }

  throw new HttpError(
      StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST, "Missing '?table=' search query parm");
}));
```

More examples can be found in the repository in
`client/testfixture/scripts/index.ts`.

### Using Rust Endpoints

The Rust APIs aren't yet stable and fairly undocumented.
That said, similar to using PocketBase as a Go framework, you can build your
own TrailBase binary and register custom Axum handlers written in rust with the
main application router, see `/examples/custom-binary`.

### Using Stored Procedures

Unlike Postgres or MySQL, SQLite does not support stored procedures out of the
box.
However, TrailBase has integrated sqlean's
[user-defined functions](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/docs/define.md)
to fill the gap. You can easily adopt SQLean in your own backends avoiding
lock-in.

### Using Virtual Tables

Likely the most bespoke approach is to expose your functionality as a custom
SQLite extension or module similar to how TrailBase extends SQLite itself.

This approach can be somewhat limiting in terms of dependencies you have
access to and things you can do especially for extensions. Modules are quite a bit
more flexible but also involved.
Take a look at [SQLite's list](https://www.sqlite.org/vtablist.html) and
[osquery](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to get a sense of what's
possible.

Besides their limitations, major advantages of using extensions or
modules are:
* you have extremely low-overhead access to your data,
* extensions and modules can also be used by services accessing the
  underlying SQLite databases.


## Bring your own Backend

The most flexible and likewise de-coupled way of running your own code is to
deploy a separate service alongside TrailBase. This gives you full control over
your destiny: runtime, scaling, deployment, etc.

TrailBase is designed with the explicit goal of running along a sea of other
services.
Its stateless tokens using asymmetric crypto make it easy for other resource
servers to hermetically authenticate your users.
TrailBase's APIs can be accessed transitively, simply by forwarding user
tokens [^1].
Alternatively, you can fall back to raw SQLite for reads, writes and even
schema alterations[^2].

[^1]:
    We would like to add service accounts in the future to authorize privileged
    services independent from user-provided tokens or using fake user-accounts
    for services.

[^2]:
    SQLite is running in WAL mode, which allows for parallel reads and
    concurrent writes. That said, when possible you should probably use the APIs
    since falling back to raw database access is a priviledge practically reserved
    to processes with access to a shared file-system.
