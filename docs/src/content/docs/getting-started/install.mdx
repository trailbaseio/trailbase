Welcome! In this *Getting Started* guide, we'll first see how to install
TrailBase, followed by tutorials on building our first small applications.

TrailBase is a **single static executable** and therefore very easy to install.
It's as simple as downloading the latest
[release](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/releases) for your
system and running it. If you prefer building your own binary, check out our
[GitHub](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase) page.

If you want to get started even quicker, you can simply run one of the
following commands:

import InstallOneLiners from "./_install_oneliners.mdx";

<InstallOneLiners />

Once installed, you can run

<Code lang="sh" code={"trail help"} frame={false} />

to check that the executable is properly installed and see all available
command line options.


## Starting the Server & Admin Dashboard

After successfully installing TrailBase above, you can run

<Code lang="sh" code={"trail run"} frame={false} />

to bring up the server on `localhost:4000`.

On first start, a `./traildepot` folder will be created. It contains
configuration, databases, secrets and a few more things.
Moreover, an admin user will be created with their credentials printed to your
terminal.
Watch out for something like:

```
Created new admin user:
        email: 'admin@localhost'
        password: '<random>'
```

Optionally, you can change the credentials to something more fitting:

<Code lang="sh" code={`
trail user change-password admin@localhost mypassword
trail user change-email admin@localhost me@mydomain.org
`} frame={false} />


<Aside type="tip" title="Starting Over">
Don't worry about breaking anything, you can always delete `traildepot` and start from scratch.
</Aside>

Armed with your new credentials, open http://localhost:4000/_/admin/ in your
browser and log in.

We encourage you to take a few minutes, click around, and maybe create a table
or two.
Note that when creating, altering, or deleting tables, indexes or views a
schema migration file will be created in `traildepot/migrations`. This allows
TrailBase to enforce consistent schemas across multiple database instances for
dev, test, prod, ... .

If you like what you see and want to get your hands dirty, consider checking
out some of the tutorials.
Lastly, if you have any issues or feedback, don't hesitate and reach out either
on [GitHub](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase) or via
*contact@trailbase.io*.
