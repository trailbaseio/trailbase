title: Type-Safety

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

TrailBase provides end-to-end type-safety from the database level, through the
HTTP APIs, all the way up to the client bindings relying on JSON schemas.
It's worth noting that the JSON schema is derived directly from the database
schema as the source of truth meaning that any schema change will be reflected
independent of whether they were applied via the admin dashboard, `sqlite3` or
other means.
This also means that you should regenerate your type definitions
after changing the schema. We therefore recommend to integrate type generation
into your build process or check the generated types in following your database
migrations.

Using JSON schema and relying on off-the-shelf code generation tools, allows to
keep the client-libraries very thin making it easy to integrate virtually any
language in a type-safe fashion.
`/examples/blog` provides a glimpse at using [quicktype](https://quicktype.io/)
to generate type-safe TypeScript and Dart APIs.

Type-safety is the main reason why TrailBase APIs require `STRICT`ly typed
tables. By default SQLite only has a notion of "type affinity" on
inserts and updates, generally allowing any data in any column.

## Generating Types from JSON Schemas

The generated JSON schemas depend on two aspects:

1. The actual database schema mapping columns and column types to fields and
   data types in a data structure of your target language.
2. The specific API operation: `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `READ`.

Expanding on 2., the notion of default values for columns means that data for
`NOT NULL` columns is optional when creating a new record but guaranteed to be
present on record read.
`UPDATE`s are point updates of existing records, thus only requiring specific
column values to be overridden.

Concretely, looking at `/examples/blog`, the data structure for inserting a new
blog article is less strict than the equivalent for retrieving an existing
article:

```typescript
// Input data type when creating a new article record.
export interface NewArticle {
  author: string;
  body: string;
  created?: number;
  id?: string;
  image?: FileUpload;
  // ...
}

// Result data type when reading an article record.
export interface Article {
  author: string;
  body: string;
  created: number;
  id: string;
  image?: FileUpload;
  // ...
}
```

## Nested JSON Columns

TrailBase also supports generating type-safe bindings for columns containing
JSON data and enforcing a specific JSON schema, see
[here](/documentation/record_apis/#custom-json-schemas).

    We do not support binary JSON, i.e. SQLite's internal JSONB
    representation at this point.
