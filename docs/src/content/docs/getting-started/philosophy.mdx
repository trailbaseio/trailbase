description: A quick look at TrailBase's philosophy and goals.
---

The ambition of TrailBase is to help solve common problems with
established, standard solutions, while being blazingly fast, avoiding
lock-in, or getting in your way.
You shouldn't have to fight your framework due to evolving product needs.
Instead, you should be able to use SQLite to its fullest, extend it, or move on
entirely if necessary.

The key for TrailBase to achieve this goal is to focus on _loose coupling_ and
_rigorous simplicity_.
Performance is merely a desirable side-effect of keeping it simple and
carefully picking the right components for doing the heavy lifting.

### _Simplicity_

To avoid demoting _simplicity_ to just another popular marketing term, let's
start by clarifying what we mean.
Simplicity is a relative property in the context of a problem:
a simple solution for a simple problem is straightforward to understand,
validate, extend or even replace.
A simple solution solution for a hard problem will naturally be more involved
but retains the above properties within a more complex context.

"Simple" is different from "easy".
An easy solution may be very complex in an effort to take on as much
responsibility as possible for very specific scenarios.
Easy solutions will sometimes yield pleasing but magic solutions that fall flat
when straying off the path.
Magic solutions will always lead to tight coupling and lock-in.
In contrast, simple solutions are explicit, apply in a wide range of scenarios
and lead to easy-to-understand, easy-to-change outcomes.

Why should I care? We believe that there are material benefits to simplicity.
For example and tying back to TrailBase:

- A simple, single-file backend dependency lets you set up **consistent**
  production, pre-prod, testing and development environments, which will help
  to improve velocity, catch issues sooner, and reduce cognitive overhead.
- Lets you change production deployments or cloud providers more easily to
  address soaring bills, ToS changes, geopolitics and policy requirements such as
  data governance.
- Lets you more easily adopt TrailBase, also selectively, and more easily drop
  it if you choose to.

### _Coupling_

The way we defined _simplicity_ above, loose coupling is already an important
property of a good-natured, simple solution. Yet, we believe it's a critical
property in its own right that should be called out explicitly to
help illustrate the guiding principles underpinning TrailBase.
Looking at two examples:

__Admin Dashboard__: TrailBase offers an easy-to-use, integrated admin dashboard.
It doesn't make TrailBase architecturally simpler but hopefully easier to use.
Importantly, it's loosely coupled to the rest of the system. It's neither
critical for serving production traffic nor setting up TrailBase.
Any dashboard task can be equally accomplished using the CLI, the configs, or
SQL.

__SQL over ORM__: TrailBase embraces SQL instead of trying to hide it. Eventually
all paths lead to SQL as the only truly cross-platform, cross-database,
cross-language solution ðŸ˜‰.
ORMs often yield simple looking examples but then fall flat soon after going
beyond the tutorial, sometimes already when joining tables.
Your data model should never be driven by the short-comings of an abstraction
forced upon you.
ORMs aren't without merit. Often, they provide type-safe APIs for accessing
the database. While more constraint, TrailBase's end-to-end type-safety
provides similar benefits.
Leaning into HTTP, JSON and JSON schema makes it easy for TrailBase to
provide consistent cross-language client-side type-safety [^1], giving you more
freedom in choosing the right tool for a specific job.

[^1]:
    Having only TypeScript and Dart bindings at the moment, this may sound more
    aspirational than practical.
    However, client bindings are only very thin layers around HTTP + JSON.
    It is straight forward to add new bindings or just use `curl` in a bunch
    of shell scripts. We're planning to add more bindings in the future.
