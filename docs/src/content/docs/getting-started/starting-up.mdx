In getting-started guide we'll bring up a local TrailBase instance, explore the
admin dashboard, and implement our first, small application.

## Starting TrailBase

The quickest way to get TrailBase up and running is to use docker:

```bash
  $ mkdir traildepot
  $ docker run -p 4000:4000 --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/traildepot,target=/app/traildepot trailbase/trailbase
```

On first start, TrailBase will generate a `traildepot` folder in your working
directory containing its configuration, the database, secrets and a few more
things.
It will also generate a new admin user for you. The credentials will be printed
on the command line as follows:

```
Created new admin user:
        email: 'admin@localhost'
        password: '<random>'
```

If you like, feel free to change the Email or password later in the dashboard.
Independently, if you ever forget your password, you can reset it using the
`trail user reset-password admin@localhost <new_pw>` command.

## The Admin Dashboard

After successfully starting TrailBase, we can check out the admin dashboard under
[http://localhost:4000/\_/admin/](http://localhost:4000/_/admin/).
After logging in with the admin credentials from the terminal, there's a couple
of pages to explore.

* First and maybe most importantly: the data browser
  (<span class="not-content inline align-middle"><Icon name="tabler:database" /></span>)
  that let's you explore and alter both the data as well as table schemas. It
  provides access to _tables_, _views_, _virtual tables_, _indexes_, _triggers_
  as well as your TrailBase API settings.
* The simple SQL editor
  (<span class="not-content inline align-middle"><Icon name="tabler:edit" /></span>)
  lets you run arbitrary queries against the database and take full control.
  It also lets you access SQLite features which aren't (yet) exposed via the
  dashboard.
* The accounts page
  (<span class="not-content inline align-middle"><Icon name="tabler:users" /></span>)
  lets you manage your registered users.
* The logs page
  (<span class="not-content inline align-middle"><Icon name="tabler:timeline" /></span>)
  lets you see what's going on. At this early stage you're probably just seeing
  your own interactions with the admin dashboard.
* The settings page
  (<span class="not-content inline align-middle"><Icon name="tabler:settings" /></span>)
  lets you configure instance-wide settings.
  Alternatively, you can also directly edit TrailBase's config file, however, unlike
  the UI you'll need to restart the server to apply the changes.
  TrailBase uses protobuf for its configuration. The schema can be
  found [here](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/blob/main/trailbase-core/proto/config.proto).

We encourage you to take a minute, click around, and maybe create a few tables.
Don't worry about breaking anything. Also note that when creating, altering, or
deleting a table a schema migration file will be created in
`traildepot/migrations`.
