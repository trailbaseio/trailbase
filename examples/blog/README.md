The main goal of this example is to be easily digestible while show-casing many
of TrailBase's capabilities both for web and cross-platform Flutter:

* Bootstrapping the database including schemas and dummy content though migration.
* End-to-end type-safety through code-generated data models for TypeScript,
  Dart and many more based on JSON Schema.
* Builtin web authentication flow (including OAuth) on web and Flutter as well
  as a custom password-based login in Flutter.
* API authorization: world readable, user editable, and moderator manageable articles.
* Different API types:
 * Table and View-based APIs for custom user profiles associating users with a
   username and keep their email addresses private as well as associating
   articles with usernames.
 * Virtual-table-based query API to expose `is_editor` authorization.
* The web client illustrates two different styles: a consumer SPA and an
  HTML-only form-based authoring UI.

Default users:

 * (email: `admin@localhost`, password: `secret`) - access to admin dash.
 * (email: `editor@localhost`, password: `secret`) - permission to write and alter blog posts.

## Instructions

### Get up and running with Docker Compose in under 2 minutes

```bash
cd $REPO/examples/blog
docker compose build
docker compose up
# Visit https://localhost and ignore the SSL error
```

### Building each piece of this example project

Generally speaking, there are roughly 2.5 moving parts to run the example, i.e:
we have to build the web UI, start the TrailBase server, and optionally start
the Flutter app. Once you have `cargo`, `pnpm`, and `flutter` installed, you
can simply run:

```bash
# From within the blog examples base directory
$ cd $REPO/examples/blog

# build and bundle the web app:
$ pnpm --dir web build

# Start TrailBase:
cargo run --bin trail -- run --public web/dist

# Start Flutter app:
$ cd flutter
$ flutter run -d <Device, e.g.: Linux, Chrome, Mobile Emulator, ...>
```

You can also try the code generation:

```bash
# Optionally delete the checked-in JSON schemas and code first
$ make clean_types

# Genarate JSON Schema and codegen types from DB schema (this requires that
# you start TrailBase first to initialize the DB)
$ make --always-make types
```
